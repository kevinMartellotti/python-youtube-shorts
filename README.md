Use cxfreeze temp.py --base-name=WIN32GUI in powershell to create the exe that will be in a folder called build.

The file "_generic_range_slider.py" is a modification of the superqt library, made for this application. It simply makes the range slide bar show a line between the 1st and the 2nd point, between the 3rd and the 4th point so that it gives information about the clips that are being made.
